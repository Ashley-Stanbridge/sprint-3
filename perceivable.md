I'm really interested in the web based text to braille technology, i had no idea it existed   
 
We are now living in an increasingly globalised world where information is more available than ever before.  
 
 
with this in mind it is crazy to think that there are so many people unable to access this rich source of information whether it be those in developing and impoverished countries with no access to the internet or persons with disabilities. 
 
 
i agree wholeheartedly with this information and believe as developers we are effectively the gatekeepers to this information and it really is our responsibility to make it accessible to everyone.
