Unfortunately i read these instructions pretty late in the week so i wasn't really able to make any adjustments to the was i have been sitting/working.  
 
 
i have now changed from working mostly on the couch pretty much laying on my neck to sitting at a desk. so over next week i will be able to Wright a more detailed account of the state of my spine. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. Do you feel any pain in your back, neck, shoulders, wrists of elsewhere that may be related? 
 
 
 
 
Yes! i have heaps of back and neck pain, but there is a very real chance it is more to do with my work and the amount of time i spend standing. I will pay closer attention to the cause and effect over next week.
