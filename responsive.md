substantially less development time. 
 
 
easier maintenance over time. 
 
 
"future proof" as it is able to change based on screen size. 
 
 
 it can easily fit new devices as it doesn't tie design to particular screen sizes. 
 
 
More widely accessible then native apps. 
 
 
 My opinion. 
 
 
 
 
 I think RWD is really cool. But in general I am far more interested in fluid / adaptive design as it  simplifies the user experience and maintains consistency
